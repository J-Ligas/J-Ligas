# 🚀 Software Engineer & Systems Integrator | Pragmatic Problem Solver

I am a developer focused on efficient technical execution and building resilient architectures. My workflow prioritizes validated solutions and clean logic over trial-and-error, optimizing development time and long-term system stability. 

I do not just write code; I design end-to-end systems, bridging the gap between software logic, hardware execution, and deployment infrastructure.

### 🧠 The Differentiator
I possess a strong analytical background spanning thermodynamics, mechanical design, and chemistry. This allows me to approach software logic with a strict engineering mindset: understanding the root cause of a problem at a physical or functional level, and building software to control, optimize, or scale that process safely. 

*Always looking to build systems that don't just work, but survive reality.*
